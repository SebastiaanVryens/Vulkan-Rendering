# Vulkan Rendering Engine

A 3D engine I wrote from scratch in **C++** using the **Vulkan** graphics API. It loads a 65k-triangle island map and lets you walk around it in first person. The player has gravity, can jump, and collides with the ground. A moving sun lights the scene, and it all runs at 120+ FPS.

I built it on my own in two weeks (May–June 2024) as a graphics programming course project.

## Highlights

- **Built directly on Vulkan.** Vulkan is a low-level graphics API. It doesn't hide anything from you, so I set up every part of the GPU work by hand: picking the graphics card, managing the images shown on screen (the swap chain), building render pipelines, allocating GPU memory, and keeping the CPU and GPU in sync.
- **First-person movement with collision.** You can walk, sprint, jump and fly. Each frame the engine casts a ray straight down from the player and tests it against every triangle in the map to find the ground.
- **Dynamic lighting.** Each pixel gets diffuse lighting from a point light plus ambient light. The light circles the scene and is drawn as a sun in the sky.
- **Data-driven scenes.** Scenes are JSON files that list which models to load, where to place them and how big they are. You can change a level without recompiling.
- **Stress-test scene.** One JSON setting fills the world with a grid of 2,000 cubes, each with a random size and rotation, to test how the renderer copes with many objects.
- **Simple physics.** A cube falls and bounces on the terrain. It uses the same gravity and collision code as the player.

## How it works

Every frame, the engine:

1. **Updates the game.** It reads keyboard and mouse input, moves the player, applies gravity and checks for ground collision.
2. **Sends shared data to the GPU.** The camera matrices and the sun's position go into a *uniform buffer*, a small block of GPU memory that every shader can read.
3. **Records draw commands.** Each object is drawn once. Its position, rotation and scale are sent with the draw call as *push constants*, a fast way to pass small per-object data.
4. **Submits and presents the frame.** The CPU and GPU work on two frames at once: while the GPU draws one frame, the CPU prepares the next.

More technical details:

- Meshes are loaded from `.obj` files with duplicate vertices merged. They're uploaded through staging buffers into GPU-only memory (the fastest kind) and drawn with index buffers.
- CMake compiles the GLSL shaders to SPIR-V automatically at build time.
- Resizing the window rebuilds the swap chain. Viewport and scissor are dynamic state, so the pipelines don't have to be rebuilt.
- The engine uses Mailbox presentation (low latency, no tearing) when the GPU supports it and falls back to standard V-Sync.
- Debug builds turn on Vulkan validation layers to catch mistakes in API usage.

## Tech stack

## Controls

| Input | Action |

| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Move |
| Hold right mouse button and drag | Look around |
| `Space` | Jump |
| `Left Shift` | Sprint |
| `E` / `Q` | Fly up / down |
| `F` | Stop flying and fall back to the ground |

## Building and running

**You'll need:**
- The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) with the GLM headers component. It also includes `glslc`, the shader compiler.
- CMake 3.10 or newer
- A C++17 compiler (I developed it with Visual Studio on Windows)

CMake downloads GLFW automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SebastiaanVryens/Vulkan-Rendering.git
cd Vulkan-Rendering
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Run `VulkanLab01` with `build/Project` as the working directory, because that's where the compiled shaders and models are copied.

**Switching scenes:** the island scene loads by default. To run the stress test, change `Models/Scene1.json` to `Models/Scene2.json` in `AppBase::LoadGameObjects()` ([Project/AppBase.cpp](Project/AppBase.cpp)).

## Project structure

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `AppBase` | Main loop: loads the scene, then updates and renders every frame |
| `EngineDevice` | Picks the GPU and creates the Vulkan device and queues |
| `SwapChain`, `Renderer` | Manage the images shown on screen, frame timing and command buffers |
| `Pipeline` | Builds graphics pipelines from compiled shaders |
| `Model`, `Buffer` | Load meshes and manage GPU memory |
| `Descriptors` | Give shaders access to the uniform buffer |
| `Systems/SimpleRenderSystem` | Draws all objects in the scene |
| `Systems/PointLightSystem` | Moves the sun and draws it |
| `Input.h` | Player controller: movement, gravity and collision |
| `SceneLoader.h` | Reads the JSON scene files |
| `Shaders/` | GLSL vertex and fragment shaders |

## What I'd improve next

- **GPU instancing.** Right now every cube in the stress test has its own vertex buffer and draw call. Instancing would draw them all with a single call.
- **Faster collision.** Testing the ray against every triangle works on this map, but a spatial structure like a BVH would let it scale to much bigger worlds.
- **Textures.** The texture files and `stb_image` are already in the repo but not connected yet.
- **Shadow mapping**
